# 2026-02-05_docker-github-actions

We can use github actions to execute code and perform processes automatically upon certain git actions!

We followed the book to perform a (more basic) version of what's covered on [this page](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science/lectures/120-containerization-3.html).

Go to the 'Actions' tab to see the actions that ran (and how many times it took us to things right...)

You can see the action we defined in this repo in the directory at `.github/workflows/`
